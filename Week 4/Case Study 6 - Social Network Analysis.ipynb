    "- Let's consider how much homophily exists in these networks. For a given characteristic, our measure of homophily will be the proportion of edges in the network whose constituent nodes share that characteristic. How much homophily do we expect by chance? If characteristics are distributed completely randomly, the probability that two nodes x and y share characteristic a is the probability both nodes have characteristic a, which is the frequency of a squared. The total probability that nodes x and y share their characteristic is therefore the sum of the frequency of each characteristic in the network. For example, in the dictionary favorite_colors provided, the frequency of red and blue is 1/3 and 2/3 respectively, so the chance homophily is (1/3)^2+(2/3)^2 = 5/9. Create a function chance_homophily(chars) that takes a dictionary with personal IDs as keys and characteristics as values, and computes the chance homophily for that characteristic.\n",
